        <h2>The Pirates of Penzance</h2>
        <h3>Act 1</h3>
        <h3>
            Scene: A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
  distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
  Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
  cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
  natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
  curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered â€” some drinking,
  some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
  one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
  seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
  kneels at his feet.</h3>
