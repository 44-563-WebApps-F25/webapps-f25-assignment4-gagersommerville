        <h2>The Pirates of Penzance</h2>
        <h3>Act 1 | Scene: A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
  distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
  Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
  cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
  natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
  curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered â€” some drinking,
  some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
  one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
  seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
  kneels at his feet.</h3>

        <pre>
            ALL:    Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
                        Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
                      And,to make us more than merry
                           Let the pirate bumper pass.

            SAMUEL: For today our pirate 'prentice
                      Rises from indentures freed;
                      Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
                      He's a pirate now indeed!

            ALL:      Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
                      Fred'ric's out of his indentures.

            SAMUEL:             
                      Two and twenty, now he's rising,
                      And alone he's fit to fly,
                      Which we're bent on signalizing
                      With unusual revelry.

            ALL:                
                      Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
                      Fred'ric's out of his indentures.
                      Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
                      Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
                      And, to make us more than merry
                      Let the pirate bumper pass.

            (FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING, who enters)

            KING:     
                      Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown
                      member of our band.

            ALL:      Hurrah!

            FREDERIC:    
                      My friends, I thank you all, from my heart, for your
                      kindly wishes.  Would that I could repay them as they
                      deserve!
